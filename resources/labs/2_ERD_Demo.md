## Background
SD-Med is a small, family-owned doctor's office that has been serving a suburban community for over 20 years. The clinic has developed a substantial patient base, but it currently relies on a paper-based system to manage patient records, appointment scheduling, and other operational tasks. Recognizing the need to modernize, SD-Med plans to implement a comprehensive digital database system. This transition aims to enhance operational efficiency, improve data accuracy, and ultimately provide better patient care.
