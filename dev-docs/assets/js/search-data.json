The clinic has developed a substantial patient base, but it currently relies on a paper-based system to manage patient records, appointment scheduling, and other operational tasks. Recognizing the need to modernize, SD-Med plans to implement a comprehensive digital database system. This transition aims to enhance operational efficiency, improve data accuracy, and ultimately provide better patient care. [!NOTE] We will only consider entity relationship data modeling concepts for this business scenario and ignore any potential HIPAA or privacy related constraints. Certain aspects of this example have been abbreviated for the purposes of this lab exercise. The scenario is not intended to represent a complete depiction of a real-world medical clinic. ",

However, some doctors may not provide primary care. | Patient information includes a unique patient identifier created by the clinic, name, date of birth, age, phone numbers, and address (street, city, state and zip). | . | Appointments are held at a single clinic and patient vitals are obtained such as blood pressure, heart rate and weight as well as the notes from the doctor. | Appointment information also includes a unique identifier for the schedule and the date and time the appointment occurred. | . | .
