## COURSE OVERVIEW

### Course Description

Databases are the backbone of the digital world, storing the vast majority of global data and enabling the seamless operation of most businesses. In this course, you will learn to design and visually represent database structures, and develop practical skills in implementing these designs using relational database concepts. Central to this course is the mastery of Structured Query Language (SQL), the standard language for interacting with relational databases. You will gain hands-on experience in writing and optimizing SQL queries, from basic to advanced levels, using a variety of open-source database platforms. Additionally, the course will introduce you to essential topics in database architecture and NoSQL databases. By the end of the course, you will be proficient in creating, modifying, retrieving, and analyzing data, preparing you with the essential skills needed to drive data-informed decisions in any professional setting.

## COURSE MATERIALS

### Textbook and Supplemental Reading

The textbook **Database Systems with SQL**, by Winsberg, Paul et al. (Mar 2024) is **NOT** required but highly recommended. This zyBook provides an interactive introduction to databases. Topics include database theory, architecture, design, and programming. The emphasis is on relational databases, but the material also covers NoSQL databases. Lecture slides, resources provided in class demos and labs, and your own supplemental research should be sufficient for this class. However, the textbook may benefit in your preparation for the materials covered in quizzes and the final exam.

Assignment and Exam grades are released typically a week after the submission date. It is your responsibility to check your grade and reach out if you believe there is a problem. Final Grades are not rounded up. Bonus points are offered on the Group Project and Challenge Question(s) as an alternative to grade rounding so take advantage of that opportunity to move up.

### Regrade Policy
The intent of the regrade policy is protect students from serious issues in grading. Email the professor within **72 hours** and provide evidence for why your answer is correct and merits a regrade (i.e. a specific reference to something said in a lecture, the readings, or office hours). Make sure you confer with your team first on any group completed project and submit one regrade request after your team comes to a consensus.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Class Attendance
The goal is to make lectures worth your while to attend. Some class dates may only consist of a lecture but the vast majority of classes will involve in-class demos and labs. Attendance is not required. 

{: .note }
Please make sure you review the Course Calendar and plan your schedule accordingly for the 3 live lab dates. These are identified in purple and class attendance **is required to complete and receive attendance credit for the lab assignment**. In some cases, the labs are intended to prepare and set you up for success on the related homework assignment.

### Course Homeworks & Topics
This class is designed to immerse you in the foundational aspects of SQL and database systems, a cornerstone in the world of analytics. Throughout this course, youâ€™ll delve into the core principles of database management, understand its significance in data-driven decision-making, and develop the essential skills for an analytics professional.

### Homework
There are 5 homework assignments consisting of problem-solving and SQL based programming assignments. The purpose is to provide students with the opportunity to apply and practice the concepts and skills learned in the lectures and demos. Homeworks may be difficult and require you to demonstrate a deeper understanding of the material.

**Late Submission Policy:**  
There is a 24-hour grace period for all homework assignments with **NO** late penalty. Homework submissions will **NOT** be accepted after the grace period. This policy is intended to be a safety net in case you experience any difficulties submitting your assignment on time. Do not view the grace period as the true due date for the assignment. If you miss a homework assignment due date, it is likely that you are not managing your time effectively and will need to adjust your planning and study habits. Please note that any excuse for not submitting assignments on time will not be accepted **AFTER** the 24-hour grace period. If you have extenuating circumstances, you must contact the professor **BEFORE** the assignment due date.

Some homework assignments are **mandatory** to be completed in a group of 2-4 students. Programming assignments may be completed on your own or with a homework partner. This means that you can work with one other student but each student must submit their own version of the assignment on Canvas/Gradescope. 

### Quizzes
There are 2 quizzes that focus primarily on the conceptual materials covered in the lectures and textbook. The format will vary between True/False, multiple choice, matching and fill in the blank style questions. Quizzes should be straightforward if you are attending class and keeping up with the material. Quizzes are just a way to make sure you keep up with studying and do not fall too far behind as this class really builds on each previous week. Quizzes are completed on Canvas and by yourself with no collaboration/communication with any other students.

### Final Exam
The comprehensive final exam is completed on Canvas and by yourself with no collaboration/communication with any other students. No late exams are permitted, except for extenuating circumstances. Please reach out to the professor as early as possible if you know something will prevent you from taking the final exam on time.
