## Support Resources

### Questions & Answers

During the course, you may have a questions related to assignments, class schedule, lecture materials etc. and may not know the best way to get these questions answered. This page is intended to guide you to the correct place to get your questions answered as quickly as possible.

**Before using any one of the options below, make sure you first, check the syllabus.**

**1. Slack Community**

This semester, we will use Slack as the central location where you can interact with your fellow classmates and professor for all questions that would benefit the entire class. These may include questions about homework assignments, lecture content, tools, and SQL query debugging. 

All of the content for this class is brand new and I fully expect there to be bugs that will need to be worked out. By posting your questions in the `#questions-answers` channel on Slack, **everyone** could potentially benefit from the response whether from the professor or another classmate.

{: .task }
> 1. Go to the [USD MSBA](https://usd-msba.slack.com) workspace.
> 2. Sign In With Google or Apple or with an Email. If you have used Slack previously, recommend you use the same sign in method.

🚨 **Important Reminder**:  
While Slack is a great tool for communication, please avoid sharing any sensitive information there. This includes:
- Student data (names, grades, or personal information)
- Confidential documents (quizzes, exams, homework solutions, etc.)
- Private conversations (between the professor, students, or other university staff)

📢 **Homework Help Guidelines: Please Read!**  
When seeking help with your homework assignments, it’s important to follow a few simple guidelines to ensure everyone benefits and maintains academic integrity as outlined on the syllabus.

🚫 Do **NOT** post full code:  
Instead of sharing your entire code, describe the problem you're facing and include only the relevant snippets where you’re stuck. This approach helps you learn more effectively and prevents others from simply copying and pasting answers.

💡 Focus on specific questions:  
Ask about concepts, logic, or errors you don't understand. For example, "I’m having trouble understanding how to use the HAVING clause," or "I’m not sure why I’m getting this error message when I run my code."

🤝 Collaboration, not cheating:  
Remember, the goal is to help you understand the material, not to give you the answers. Let’s work together to ensure everyone learns and grows!

If you’re unsure about how much to share, err on the side of caution, direct message (DM) the professor or use #2 below.

**2. Email**

If you have a sensitive or private related matter, [email](dcyoung@sandiego.edu) is the best way to reach me, just include your full name and MSBA504. Please consider that I'm a part-time Adjunct Faculty member but I strive to respond within 24 hours Mon – Fri and by Monday, at the latest, if received over the weekend.

**3. In Person Office Hours**

I plan on being on campus early on Tuesdays and Thursdays so feel free to drop into the classroom KCBE328 between 3:30 - 4:00PM to get any of your questions answered.

**4. Zoom Office Hours**

I also utilize Calendly where you can schedule a 30 minute student hours session with me. This app checks my calendar across all other commitments and is a great way to get 1:1 support remotely. Click [here](https://calendly.com/professor-cyoung/student-hours) to book a time.
